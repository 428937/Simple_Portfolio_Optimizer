# Simple_Portfolio_Optimizer
A small, beginner-friendly FinTech project demonstrating portfolio optimization using NumPy.

This small Python project demonstrates portfolio optimization using a local search algorithm to maximize the return-to-risk ratio. It generates random covariance matrices (RCM) to simulate asset relationships and iteratively adjusts portfolio weights through small perturbations with occasional random exploration.
